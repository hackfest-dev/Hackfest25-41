Teams must create a system that can map user responses to three pre-defined onboarding pathways (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced), delivering tailored tutorials and feature highlights within a 60-second interactive sequence, while logging user progress for future analysis; deliverable: a functional prototype demonstrating the automated pathway selection and content delivery.",
