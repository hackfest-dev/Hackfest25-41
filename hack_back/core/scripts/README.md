# Meals

**Meals** is an innovative app designed to modernize the meal management process in hostel messes by replacing the traditional coupon system with a digital solution. This app provides a streamlined experience for both students and hostel staff, improving convenience, security, and food management.

## The Problem with the Traditional Coupon System

The traditional coupon system in hostels presents several challenges:

1.  **Inconvenience:** Students must physically go to the hostel off...
2.  **Limited Tracking:** It's difficult to track which meals were consumed and by whom accurately.
3.  **Lack of Transparency:**  Itâ€™s hard for staff to see what students are eating.
4. **No Meal History**: There is no record of which meals have been eaten.

## The Solution: A Digital Approach

Our app addresses these issues with a user-friendly digital solution that offers the following benefits:

*   **Real-time Tracking:** Students can easily log their meals, and the system automatically tracks consumption.
*   **Secure Food Management:** Staff can monitor food intake and identify potential issues like overconsumption or misuse of food.
*   **Enhanced Transparency:**  Students and staff can view a detailed meal history for each user.
*   **Simplified Reporting**: Provides clear data on food consumption patterns, aiding in resource allocation and planning.

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following technologies:

*   **Flutter:** The primary framework for building the mobile application.
*   **Cloud Firestore:**  A NoSQL cloud database to store user meal data and preferences.
*   **Firebase Authentication:**  For user authentication and authorization.
*   **flutter_animated:** For rendering animated UI elements
*   **QR Code Dart Scan:** For scanning QR codes for efficient food tracking
