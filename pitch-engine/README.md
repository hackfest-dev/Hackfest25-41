Hook (0:00–0:30)

“Imagine you walk into a hackathon or research sprint with confidence—no more blank‑screen paralysis, no last‑minute README panic, and no guesswork in your pitch. Hackinator replaces that chaos with a seamless AI co‑pilot that generates tailored problem statements, facilitates real‑time brainstorming, drafts your repo README, and even simulates judge or reviewer questions.” 


---

Problem (0:30–1:00)

Blank‑Screen Syndrome: Teams spend precious hours ideating under stress, often cycling through the same tired ideas instead of building solutions.

Documentation Drag: Writing README files can derail coding sprints, diverting attention from core development.

Pitch Panic: Under time pressure, teams deliver generic pitches that undersell their innovation.

Solution (1:00–1:45)

1. Problem Selector: Upload a hackathon brochure or key research papers—Hackinator’s RAG pipeline extracts themes and suggests novel, context‑grounded problem statements while ensuring each is semantically unique via embedding‑based novelty filters.


2. DiscussionGPT: Engage in iterative, GPT‑powered Q&A to refine scope, explore edge cases, and validate feasibility through a lightweight transformer‑based classifier.


3. README Generator: Provide your GitHub URL—Hackinator clones or fetches key files, infers the tech stack, and auto‑drafts a polished README.md using template + AI completion.


4. Pitch Assistant: Hackinator crafts a concise slide/script and anticipates judge questions by analyzing your repo and domain trends, enabling confidence under the 3‑minute deadline.
