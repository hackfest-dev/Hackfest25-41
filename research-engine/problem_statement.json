  "problem_statement": "Develop a solution for optimizing last-mile delivery routes for a hyperlocal grocery store chain utilizing real-time order data, dynamic traffic information (via a simulated Google Maps API), and pre-defined service time windows. The system must dynamically adjust routes based on predicted delivery urgency (prioritized by order age) and current road conditions, aiming to minimize the average delivery distance within a 3-mile radius for each order while maintaining an average delivery time of under 30 minutes â€“ deliverable: a functional prototype capable of simulating route optimization for 50 simulated orders per hour displayed on a map interface with key metrics including total distance traveled, average delivery time, and fuel efficiency (simulated), incorporating a mechanism to reroute due to a simulated 10-minute traffic delay."
